        The thesis of this article relates to how designing for screens is a concept that revolves around constant
        change. He describes how there are three different levels of change and how they each contribute to the
        development of customization, responsiveness, variability, etc. He defines these changes as “flux”. Chimero
        explains how flux is much more than just aesthetics. Flux impacts the way that we communicate, and interact with
        screens. In order to adapt to these changes, Chimero suggests that we need to think outside of the box and not
        just build upon what was created before us. He compares this to an example of a map and how it distorts our view
        of the real world because of its inaccuracies. Instead of basing our knowledge of the world around us around the
        map, we should figure out other ways of interpreting the world around us.



        Although I find value in both skeuo and flat ideologies, I find that skeuo is likely the option that will find
        more success in the future. In a world of constantly developing technology, designing for screens will only get
        more complicated over time. Like Chimero says, you shouldn’t base your designs on flat aesthetics because the
        screen told you to. To advance the possibilities of interaction design, we need to rework our design techniques
        and intentions. Skeuo design allows us to completely redefine what interacting with a screen would look like,
        and I personally find that more interesting than sticking with the same flat design that has existed for
        decades.


        A zoopraxiscope is a sequence of photos playing in a loop. This film technique was revolutionary at the time
        because it was the first instance of displaying moving images. It has inspired aspects of web design such as
        animations and GIFs. Other aspects of film have been integrated into web design as well, for example; a
        television remote. These remote controllers have the ability to pause, play, rewind, and fast forward. On most
        online media players such as Youtube, these same functionalities are readily available. Web design takes
        inspiration from real life, and this is just one of the endless examples of this phenomenon.
