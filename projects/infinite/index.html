        <p style="font-size: 60px;">Website as an infinite. Within the world wide web, hundreds of thousands are being
            produced everyday. This
            number will only grow as technology continues to evolve at an exponential rate. Within each website contains
            massive amounts of information displayed via abounding amounts of code. Many of these websites are
            interactive in one way or another, which allwos each user to experience them in different ways. With this in
            mind, you or any individual will never have the time or pace to experience even a fraction of the nearly
            infinite amount of websites that exist. Similar to how an individual cannot count to the largest number in
            existence, because the amount is ever growing, it is infinite. Social media pages such as Instagram or
            Tiktok reflect this because no matter how far you scroll, there will always be more content to uncover. </p>
