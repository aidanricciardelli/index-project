        1. Drucker claims that “interface” is much more than just a screen display with menus, buttons, and icons to
        interact with.The interface is really a tool used to bridge the gap between the user alongside behaviors, tasks,
        and functions. It also sets the limitations for what a user can and cannot do within a digital environment. She
        points out that interface design processes typically lack a clear outline for its design intentions. She also
        mentions that attempts for integrating humanistic design are either lackluster or non-existent.




        2. According to Drucker, humanistic design is subject oriented rather than human oriented. The main goal of the
        humanistic approach isn’t to keep the user satisfied and engaged, rather to build on the analysis of how we
        interact with literary, media, and visual studies. Humanistic design asks us to reflect on questions such as
        “Who is the subject of the interface?”, “How are we produced as subjects of the discourses on the screen?” and
        “How do our embodied and cultural situations relate to screens and displays?”. Essentially this type of design
        is used to utilize inclusivity through language, image, ritual, spatial relations, as well as other cultural and
        social systems.




        3. Drucker explains some of the important concepts of interface design such as the humanistic approach, however
        she left out many key components of this subject. An area that could have been added is technical aspects such
        as responsiveness or load times. Optimization of elements within an interface is important yet often overlooked.
        Reducing long load times by cutting down on unnecessary code and animation can help improve accessibility for
        users who use lower quality equipment. I feel that these points should have been included, especially since the
        reading’s main purpose is to explain why and how humanistic design should be implemented in these interfaces.
